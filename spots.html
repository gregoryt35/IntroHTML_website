        <p>One spot I really enjoy going to is Washington Square Park. When I get the chance I like to go to the park with friends and even by myself as it just puts me in a good mood with its beautiful surroundings.</p>

        <p>One spot I do not enjoy are the subway stations. Most subway stations are very dirty and infested with rats. I wish the city put more money and time into making transportation better.</p>

        <p>Another spot that I really enjoy is the Brooklyn Bridge. I like to ride my bike across the bridge because the views are really nice and the wind blowing in my face feels amazing. Here is a video of the Brooklyn Bridge:</p>
